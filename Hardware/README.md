There are 7 files in this folder: 
1) TuMan_core.v:  A small but pipelined RISC-V (RV32I) processor (core 
                  processing logic)
2) TuMan_top.v:   Connect the TuMan_core and instrcution/data ram (ITCM/DTCM)
3) memory.v:      Instrcution ram (ITCM) and data ram (DTCM)
4) conf_mem.v:    Used to configure/initializing ITCM/DTCM (by Ethernet 
                  packet whose type is 0x9001-0x9004); Another function
                  is output the "print" generated by TuMan_core (by Eth
                  packet whose type is 0x9005)
5) gen_data_instr.v:  Read program from binary file i.e., firmware.hex,
                  and generate Ethernet packet in FAST format to configure
                  ITCM and DTCM
6) testbench_for_P2RV.v:  A testbench for this project
7) firmware.hex:  binary file i.e., firmware.hex, generated by risc-tools
                  (currently, we do only support RISCV-32I)
