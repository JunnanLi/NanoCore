# TuMan
A Pipelined RISC-V Core

# Hardware part
There are 8 files in "Hardware" folder

| file name | function description |
|-----------|----------------------|
| TuMan_core.v |  A small but pipelined RISC-V (RV32I) processor (core processing logic) |
| TuMan_top.v |   Connect the TuMan_core and instrcution/data ram (ITCM/DTCM)
| memory.v |      Instrcution ram (ITCM) and data ram (DTCM) |
| conf_mem.v |    Used to configure/initializing ITCM/DTCM (by Ethernet packet whose type is 0x9001-0x9004); Another function is output the "print" generated by TuMan_core (by Ethernet packet whose type is 0x9005) |
| um.v |          A top file of [FAST program](http://www.fastswitch.org/) (an open source object), to connect conf_mem.v and TuMan_core.v |
| gen_data_instr.v |  Read program from binary file i.e., firmware.hex, and generate Ethernet packet in FAST format to configure ITCM and DTCM |
| testbench_for_P2RV.v |  A testbench for this project |
| firmware.hex |  binary file i.e., firmware.hex, generated by risc-tools (currently, we do only support RISCV-32I) |

# Software part
There are 2 floders in "Software" folder: 
1) firmware: used to generate firmware.hex
see readme in "firmware" folder

2) controller: used to control cpu
see readme in "controller" folder

# Simulation
Run this program, and you will get following result:
"Hello, AoTuman!"
