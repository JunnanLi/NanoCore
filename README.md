# TuMan
A Pipelined RISC-V Core

# Hardware part
There are 8 files in "Hardware" folder: 
1) TuMan_core.v:\t  A small but pipelined RISC-V (RV32I) processor (core 
                  processing logic)
2) TuMan_top.v:\t   Connect the TuMan_core and instrcution/data ram (ITCM/DTCM)
3) memory.v:      Instrcution ram (ITCM) and data ram (DTCM)
4) conf_mem.v:    Used to configure/initializing ITCM/DTCM (by Ethernet 
                  packet whose type is 0x9001-0x9004); Another function
                  is output the "print" generated by TuMan_core (by Eth
                  packet whose type is 0x9005)
5) um.v:          A top file of FAST program (an open source object, you 
                  can visit by http://www.fastswitch.org/), to connect 
                  conf_mem.v and TuMan_core.v
6) gen_data_instr.v:  Read program from binary file i.e., firmware.hex,
                  and generate Ethernet packet in FAST format to configure
                  ITCM and DTCM
7) testbench_for_P2RV.v:  A testbench for this project
8) firmware.hex:  binary file i.e., firmware.hex, generated by risc-tools
                  (currently, we do only support RISCV-32I)

# Software part
There are 2 floders in "Software" folder: 
1) firmware: used to generate firmware.hex
see readme in "firmware" folder

2) controller: used to control cpu
see readme in "controller" folder

# Simulation
Run this program, and you will get following result:
"Hello, AoTuman!"
